 Project Title:
Sumantra’s Breakfast Diner
Motivation:
The motivation for writing this code is to be able to have practise for coding and try to revise my previously learnt skills in the semester. I would also like to create a practical code that could help someone’s restaurant business. I also wanted to learn some new things about coding and become a better coder by doing this program.
Code Style:
I used regular standard code where there is a set of rules, space between parameters, identations, empty line between logic blocks, lines are not very long, else without a line break etc.
ScreenShots:

  Features:
The features that I have included in this program benefit the structure how how a restaurant operates their day to day business. Some of the features include a reservation system, time for when the guest should be seated and what table number, using randomizer. Our restaurant also offers 12 different items and 5 working different payment methods. There is also a two-dimensional menu that display the price of the 12 different items, using a two-dimensional array. Users are also able to leave a tip for their waiter/waitress and the end of the bill. The final bill will calculate the subtotal, tax, tip left and final total. There is also a current time and date stamp on the top of the bill, to show proof of purchase.

 How to Use/About:
My code is very simple and easy to grasp by any user or business owner. In the code itself, there are numerous comments that are explaining each step of the code. The code first starts of by displaying the current date and time and the company name(in ASCII). Then there will be a welcome statement that will be asking for the users name. Next the user will be asked if they have a reservation and they can answer by typing(Yes or No). If you type no,a wait time will pop up and if you type yes it will directly ask you how many people are here and will be assigned a table number.
The menu will then pop up listing each item and their price, and the user will be asked what item would they like to purchase. The user is able to type in the name of the item and followed by the quantity. After that you’ll be asked if you want anything else(“User will type Y/N”). Then it’ll loop again asking the customer for what item and quantity.
When user selects “N” for anything else, the code will jump to the first bill, which will have the current date and time, followed by the restaurant name. Each item purchased will be listed with the quantity purchased and total price. Then the user will be asked to place a tip of 0%-20%. The final bill will then print displaying the subtotal, tax, tip left and final total. It’ll finally ask the user to choose preferred payment method from the 5 offered(debit, credit, cash, e-transfer and bitcoin). After payment method is selected and payment options are complete, there will be a final thank you statement that will be printed out.
